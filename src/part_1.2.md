### How can music change the way we see the world?

#### Idea 1

Some things have the power to “break category boundaries.” The mind builds a “semantic model” of its experience, which you can imagine as being sort of like the book classification systems in libraries — the “life science” books are down the aisle from the “chemistry” books, right? These are seen by the librarian as separate categories, and librarians get all annoyed when there’s books which cross categories because they try to straddle the boundaries between different domains and integrate them, etc.

Similarly, our minds are classifying their knowledge and beliefs about the world, and sorting experience into “relevant to me” and “not relevant to me”, and similar boxes that are generally self-centered. Like a librarian sorting books, we’re sorting our experience and there’s a kind of psychological comfort when everything fits and we “know” what’s going on.

But those categories are artificial… they’re “constructions of meaning.” And if you sort everything neatly, and then you’re done, it gets boring and lifeless in the library. Music and art and dance and similar creative expressions run around the library and grab books from different shelves and throw them up in the air to see what happens: the setting sun and the beat of the drums and the way she told you she’d never love you again… it all blends together and new possibilities of meaning emerge as the category boundaries are broken.

Nobody “knows” where music could go, the possibilities transcend our ability to classify outcomes in advance. It creates new worlds by tearing down the walls of the old ones, and there’s no limit to that.

This isn’t just about music, of course. It’s the nature of authentic self-expression in general, music is just one form of that.

Music can change the way we see the world in a way we want to see

Music has a lot of impact to those who love to listen songs and it entirely depends on the type of songs and type of music we listen.I love music and this is exactly how I feel.

If I listen to love songs than suddenly I will remember my love stories and loved ones and feel good about the music and the song because of the person I am imagining at that time.I listen to melody and slow music thats when I want to relax and have a peace of mind.

when I am depressed I will listen to the songs which motivates me and tells me that its ok you still have this and this is what you can do.When I am in a party than I enjoy the party music or party songs.

If I want to show attitude and think like i don’t give a damn about anything than I will go for rap songs and hip hop music.

Now if i listen to depressed songs when i am depressed my situation gets worse and vice versa applies for all the cases.This is how I listen to the music and the world around me.

I listen mostly to HIP HOP music and POP music.
