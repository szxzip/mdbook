### Opening Remarks 

（开场弄个提问环节）（bushi）

Hello everyone, and welcome to today’s presentation! As we go through life, music is a constant companion. From the simple nursery rhymes of childhood to the pop hits of adolescence, and later, to the more complex and introspective melodies of adulthood, our musical preferences evolve in ways that mirror our inner worlds and personal growth.

Before we dive in, I'd like to ask you to think back for a moment: what kind of music did you listen to at different stages of your life? Perhaps there were childhood songs you loved to sing with your family, or teenage anthems that defined your group of friends. These musical moments have all played a role in shaping who we are, and even if we don't listen to those songs anymore, they still carry a certain emotional resonance.

If you're comfortable sharing, I'd love to hear about the music that marked different phases of your life. These personal experiences can help set the stage for our discussion today.

In the next part of our presentation, we'll explore how our musical tastes shift across various stages of life, and reflect on how these changes align with our emotional and cognitive growth. Let’s begin this journey through the soundtrack of our lives!

### Childhood: Exploration and Simplicity

### Why These Changes Occur

1. **Cognitive Development**: As we grow, our **brains** become better at processing **complexity**, leading us to appreciate more intricate music.

2. **Emotional Growth**: Life experiences, relationships, and challenges **shape our emotional needs**, which music fulfills in different ways.

3. **Social Context**: In childhood and adolescence, external influences like **family and peers dominate**. In adulthood, personal choice and **individuality** take precedence.

### What It Reveals About Growth

Shifting Needs: Childhood music reflects a need for simplicity and joy, adolescence captures exploration and identity-building, and adulthood highlights a search for meaning and comfort.

**Emotional Maturity**: The progression from surface-level enjoyment to deeper emotional and intellectual connection mirrors our psychological and emotional development.

Ultimately, the evolution of our musical tastes serves as a soundtrack to our personal growth, with each phase offering insight into the person we were, are, and aspire to be.
